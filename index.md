# Research
I received my bachelor’s degree in Genomics and Molecular Genetics with a minor in Mathematics from Michigan State University in 2012. With an interest in computational genomics, I earned my doctoral degree in Genetics and Genome Sciences while working in [Dr. Thomas LaFramboise](http://mendel.gene.cwru.edu/laframboiselab/)’s lab at Case Western Reserve University.

During my graduate career, I acquired a strong skillset in big data analysis and biostatistics, which was funded by two graduate research fellowships from NIH ([NCI F31 NRSA](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9290948&icde=42267630&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=) and [NIGMS CMBTP](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8885837&map=y)) and resulted in six peer-reviewed scientific publications, two freeware software packages, two productive collaborations, and several awards (see below).
