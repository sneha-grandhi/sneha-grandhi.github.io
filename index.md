## Overview

I am a highly enthusiastic and creative scientist investigating selective pressures placed on the human genome. I’ve garnered significant skills in bioinformatics, computational genomics, data mining, next generation sequencing, cell culture, grant writing, and public speaking.       

## Background

I received my bachelor’s degree in Genomics and Molecular Genetics with a minor in Mathematics from Michigan State University in 2012. With an interest in computational genomics, I joined [Dr. Thomas LaFramboise](http://mendel.gene.cwru.edu/laframboiselab/)’s lab at Case Western Reserve University where I went on to earn my doctoral degree in Genetics and Genome Sciences in 2018.

During my graduate career, I acquired a strong skillset in big data analysis and biostatistics, which was funded by two graduate research fellowships from NIH ([NCI F31 NRSA](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9290948&icde=42267630&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=) and [NIGMS CMBTP](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8885837&map=y)) and resulted in six peer-reviewed scientific publications, two freeware software packages, two productive collaborations, and several awards (see below).
